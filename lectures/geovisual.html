<p>visual analytics
<p>communication of geospatial information
</section>

   <h3>Display of raster and vector data</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">all data displayed on computer screen are rasters 
 <li class="fragment">raster data display: as we zoom in, pixels show up, we can reinterpolate to avoid visible pixels
 <li class="fragment">vector data display: scalable, preserves shape as we zoom-in
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Display of large rasters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If the number of rows or columns in a raster is greater than those of map display,
not all pixels are visible
  <li class="fragment">raster lines representation is broken 
  <li class="fragment">solution? convert to vector representation
</ul>

   <h3>Working with color</h3>
<p>
Color definition as RGB ....., hue and intensity
hue, lightness, and saturation
<p>
Color for raster data: discrete or continuous 
(interpolated RGB values based on the values in the raster map)
<p>
Color for vector data: discrete by definition
<p>

<section>
   <h3>Colors for discrete raster data</h3>
<p>
quantitative data: intensity as function of values
example: soil erodibility 
<p>qualitative data: constant intensity, discrete hue
<p> Image composite - erodibility and landuse examples #10
<p>Brewer - example of discrete color ramps for cartography
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Colors for continuous raster data</h3>
<p>
Continuous data are quantitative data 
<p>continuous color ramps highlight the continuous property
<p class="credit">(note: default is often greyscale with uniform interval)</p>
<p>discrete color ramp limits the information but makes the interval values easier to identify
<p> Image composite - histogram and color ramp cont and discrete
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Colors for continuous raster data</h3>
<p>
Distribution of color based on uniform raster data intervals
<p class="credit">Works for Wake, for NC highlights that most NC is flat coastal plane
but we don't see the topography structure
<p> Image composite - histogram and color ramp Wake and NC
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Histogram equalized color</h3>
<p>
Distribution of color based on histogram of raster data values
<p class="credit"> highlights topography structure, distorts the elevation differences
<p> Image composite - histogram equalized and custom color ramp NC
<p>Equation or graph?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Color for data with non-linear distributions</h3>
<p>
Example: flow accumulation data range over several magnitudes
<p>Display with uniform interval, histogram equalized and logarithmic color ramps
<p> Image composite - flowaccumulation uniform, hist eq, log
<p>split into 3 slides
<p>Equation or graph?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Relief shading</h3>
<p>
Color composite (intensity+hue) highlights the relationship between the theme values
represented by color and the surface (topography) structure
<p>
<ul>
  <li>intensity: shaded relief (illuminated topography in greyscale)
  <li>hue: theme values (elevation, watersheds, land cover as color map)
</ul>
<p> Image composite - elevation map with relief shading
<p> Equations for illuminated relief and composite
</section>

<section>

follow conventions for baseline data, national standards 
<p class=small>
<ul>
  <li>lines: color and symbols
  <li>polygons: color and fill, transparency
  <li>points: color and symbols
  <li>colors and symbols are assigned based on attributes
  <li>general rules for quantitative and qualitative data apply
  <li>relation between symbol size, line width and scale
  <li>adding labels: complex algorithms for automated positioning of labels 
</ul>
